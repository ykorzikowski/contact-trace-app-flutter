# contact-trace-app-flutter
My target is to build a simple contact trace diary app to reconstruct your contacts when there is an infection. 


- Privacy: everything after a period of 14 days is deleted
- Security: possibility to sync files with cloud but only encrypted
- Simplicity: simple UI, only as much data as needed
- Open: Open Source and Apache2 licensed
- Cross Platform: Use it on android, ios and web
- Export: Export your contact diary to a simple csv file for your local health institution
